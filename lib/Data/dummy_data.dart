        "As a founder, I don't care, Where my employees work from. When my employees do their work. If their camera is on or off during meetings.  If they take mental health days. If some weeks they clock less than 40 hours. I hired these people because they are awesome at what they do. I trust them to do their jobs well, in ways that work for them. If you don't trust your people... Why hire them in the first place?",
